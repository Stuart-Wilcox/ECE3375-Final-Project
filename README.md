# ECE3375-Final-Project
Final project for ECE3375 Microprocessors & Microcomputers

The idea for the project is to take input from the keypad and use the value to turn the stepper motor at a speed related to the key's value.
Stepper motors produce different pitches depending on their speed, thus they keypad keys can be used as sound output controls using the stepper motor as a speaker.

The project was created for the lab's customized HC12 microprocessors with onboard keypad and stepper motor.
